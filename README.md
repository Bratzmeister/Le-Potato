    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```  

    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Install on Linux / MacOs</summary>

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

    </details>

* **Now we need to activate it to be able to use Le Potato without libraries error!**
    <details>
    <summary>Install on Windows</summary>

    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
    ```  

    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Install on Linux / MacOs</summary>

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    </details>

* **Now we are inside our virtual environment...You will have to install all python libraries to be able to use the web app by using:**

    <details>
    <summary>Install on Windows</summary>

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```  

    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Install on Linux / MacOs</summary>

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    </details>

* **While it is installing, you should check and modify the configuration file**  
**There you will find some samplers and other settings to modify to host model...**

```python
database/configuration.yaml
```

* **Once you are done, you can launch the web server if the libraries are done installing!**

    <details>
    <summary>Install on Windows</summary>

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```  

    </details>
    <details>

    ```

    </details>
